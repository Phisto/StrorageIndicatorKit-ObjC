# StrorageIndicatorKit

The StrorageIndicatorKit framework provides a storage indicator view similar to the storage bar in a Mac's "About This Mac" storage section.


## Requirements

-  macOS 10.13+

  
## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate StrorageIndicatorKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "Phisto/StrorageIndicatorKit-ObjC" ~> 0.1
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use Carthage, you can integrate StrorageIndicatorKit into your project manually.
You only need to build and add the StrorageIndicatorKit framework (StrorageIndicatorKit.framework) to your project. 


## Usage

Build and run the example project to see the usage.
